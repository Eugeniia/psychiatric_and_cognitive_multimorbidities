# psychiatric_and_cognitive_multimorbidities
This repository contains the data analysis and visualisation scripts for the
study [*Decoding the multimorbidities among psychiatric disorders and
cognitive functioning*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/837914v1).

In this study we performed an integrated analysis of 2,893 GWAS SNPs
(associated with cognition, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, unipolar
depression and schizophrenia) with data on the 3D genome organization and eQTLs
to identify tissue-specific spatial regulatory impacts associated with the
development of psychiatric disorders and cognitive functioning.
